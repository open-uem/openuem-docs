If you have Linux endpoints, this is your lucky day! OpenUEM has now agents for Debian based distributions. You can now install agents for Debian, Ubuntu and Linux Mint distributions.

These agents will gather your Linux system information and will display it on the console. Also, you will be able to browse the content of the remote filesystems, open remote desktop sessions using VNC or RDP (depending on the display manager used) and deploy packages using Flatpak.

Linux agents for other distributions are being developed right now (Fedora, OpenSUSE, Arch, Manjaro, Alma Linux...) so be patient

You can learn more about these agents reading: https://openuem.eu/docs/Installation/Agent/debian-ubuntu
