OpenUEM has a new feature: profiles. Profiles allow you to create a group of tasks that will be performed at your endpoints so you can automate many configuration steps.
Profiles can be used with OpenUEM Server 0.4.0 and OpenUEM Agent 0.3.X

A profile is a group of tasks. You can apply a profile to every endpoint or to endpoints that have a tag. OpenUEM uses WinGet to apply a configuration file which can contain the following tasks:
-	Install or uninstall software packages
-	Add registry keys, values, update a keyâ€™s default value or delete keys or values.
-	Add or remove a local user
-	Add or remove a local group. Add users to a group or remove user from a group.

Every 30 minutes the agents will contact the Agent Worker to check if profiles are ready to apply to the endpoint.
