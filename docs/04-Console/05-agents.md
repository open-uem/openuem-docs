# ðŸ•µ Agents

The agents gather information about your endpoints and report it back to the OpenUEM server.

All the agents can be found in the Agents view:

![Agents view](/img/console/agents_list.png)

## 1. Agents' life cycle

When [an agent is installed](/docs/Installation/Agent/windows) on an endpoint, it tries to contact the NATS server and send its report so the Agent worker can process that information and save it to the database.

The Agent worker will set the state of the agent to **"Waiting for admission"**. While the agent is in this state, the agent can send its report periodically you can browse its information, but the agent can't be managed from the console and won't be shown in charts and statistics.

:::tip

The dashboard has a warning about how many agents are waiting for admission. You can click on the link to visit a filtered view of the agents in that state.

:::

If you want to admit the agent (or several agents at once) you can check the agent and use the Admit button, or you can click on the three dots button and use the Admit button individually.

Once you admit the agent, its state is now **"Enabled"** and you can now see its information in other sections like Computers, Security... Also, when the agent is admitted, a certificate (and its associated private key) is generated by the Cert-Manager Worker that is used by the agent to use TLS with the SFTP server and the VNC Proxy.

:::note
The new certificate has the name server.cer and its private key the name server.key and both files should be found in the agent's certificate folder which is located at `C:\Program Files\OpenUEM Agent\certificates`
:::

The agent in the **"Enabled state"** (or Waiting for Admission) sends its information periodically every 60 minutes. You can change the agents' refresh time in Admin -> General Settings -> Agents report frequency

You can set the state of an agent to **"Disabled""** which means that the agent is kept in the database, but the agent won't send more reports until you enable it again.

## 2. More actions

If the agent is in the **"Waiting for admission"** state, you can only admit it or delete it.

If the agent is in the **"Enabled""** state, you have the following actions:

- Force report. You can tell an agent that you want it to send you a new report, no matter the report frequency that is set.
- Disable the agent to avoid receiving new reports.
- Regenerate a certificate. A request is made to generate new certificates for the agent's SFTP and VNC proxy servers.
- Force restart. If you think that the agent may not be working fine or that it could have been hung up, you can try to force a restart of the service.
- Remote assistance. You can try to open a remote assistance session using VNC.
- Wake on Lan. If your endpoint is in the same LAN where the OpenUEM server lives, you can try to send a magic packet to boot it up.
- Delete. You can delete the agent but note that, unless you uninstall the agent, it'll keep trying to send new information.

If you click on the hostname associated with the agent you'll visit the Computers view

## 3. PDF Report (ðŸŽ¯ 0.2.0)

You can generate a PDF report that lists your agents and preserves your filters and sorting using the PDF button in the section header.

Hereâ€™s a sample of the generated report.
