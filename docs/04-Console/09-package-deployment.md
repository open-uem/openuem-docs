# ðŸ“¦ Package deployment

You can deploy software packages to Windows endpoints using WinGet.
OpenUEM downloads daily the database of packages available at WinGetâ€™s repository so you can search for those packages.

## Install packages

Introduce a text to search for packages. Click on the package icon to select the package to install.

Then, select the endpoints where you want to install the package.

A request to install the package will be sent to OpenUEM agents.

:::info
If an agent hasnâ€™t contacted recently, the request will be sent to the agent as soon as it contacts thanks to the NATS server that stores pending messages.

## Uninstall packages

The process to uninstall a package from several hosts is like installing a package.

Introduce a text to search for packages. Click on the package icon to select the package to uninstall.

Then, select the endpoints that will receive the request to uninstall the package. The request will be sent to OpenUEM agents.
