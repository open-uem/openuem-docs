# ðŸ›‚ Log In / Log Out

## Log In

OpenUEM comes with a web user interface named **OpenUEM Console**

The console can work behind a [reverse proxy](/docs/Advanced%20Topics/reverse-proxy) or be served right away from the Console component on port 1323 by default.

The log in page looks like this:

:::warning
If you see a security warning your browser may not trust in the Certification Authority. Please visit the [guide](/docs/Advanced%20Topics/user-certificate) to import certificates
:::

To log in to the console, you'll need to have a user certificate installed in your browser. In the server setup for Windows or Linux, if you've selected to auto generate the certificates, an admin certificate will be created and placed under certificates\user and both the CA certificate and the user certificate should be imported automatically.

![Select Certificate](/img/console/select_certificate.png)

:::warning
When you click the log in button you'll have to select the certificate. If no certificate is shown check if you've imported the certificate to the Personal certificates store. Please visit the [guide](/docs/Advanced%20Topics/user-certificate) to import certificates
:::

If authentication works fine, you'll see the **Dashboard** which is documented in the next section.

## Sessions

OpenUEM has **sessions that last 24 hours by default**, after that time you'll have to log in again.

You can set a different session lifetime visiting Admin -> General Settings
