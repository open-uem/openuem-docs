:::info
OpenUEM uses semver versions X.Y.Z. When you download an agent choose the latest agent installer compatible with the major version installed for your server. For example, if you have a 1.3.0 server installed use an agent 1.X.X or better a 1.3.X agent.

:::warning
As OpenUEM is a new project, Microsoft Edge can warn you that the file to be downloaded cannot be trusted by Microsoft as it's a file that is not downloaded commonly and you'll have to force the browser to keep that file to download it. Hopefully, soon, this warning will disappear as a report has been sent to Microsoft.
