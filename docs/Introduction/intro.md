# What is OpenUEM?

OpenUEM is an **open-source unified endpoint manager** which keeps an inventory of your IT assets reported by agents installed on your endpoints.

This project could also be named OpenRMM as it shares many features with a Remote Monitoring and Management tool, but the name was already picked.

# Why OpenUEM?

I’ve managed IT systems for many years and I’ve to admit that the tasks involved are hard and not sexy. IT Admins deserve the more help they can get to do their job.
While there are some nice commercial and open-source tools out there, I found that some of these tools offered too much information or were too bloated and I wanted something different that would give me a clean and concise view of what I must manage.
