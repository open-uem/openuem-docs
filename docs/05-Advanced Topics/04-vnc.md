# üïπÔ∏è VNC

OpenUEM allows you to initiate remote assistance sessions using VNC if your endpoint has a supported VNC server.
Right now, OpenUEM supports the following three freeware or open-source programs:

- [TightVNC](https://www.tightvnc.com/download.php)
- [UltraVNC](https://uvnc.com/downloads/ultravnc/159-ultravnc-1-4-3-6.html)
- [TigerVNC - winvnc](https://sourceforge.net/projects/tigervnc/files/stable/1.14.1/)

This page explains some of the recommendations to install these programs on your endpoints.
