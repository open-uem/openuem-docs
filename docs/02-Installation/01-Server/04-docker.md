# üê≥ Docker

OpenUEM can be tested using Docker containers that are hosted in [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/openuem)

You can use [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to install all OpenUEM components in a single machine following these steps:

## 1. Get the docker-compose file

Clone the openuem-docker repository:

```(bash)
git clone https://github.com/open-uem/openuem-docker
```

## 2. Create a .env file with environment variables to be used

Use the file named `.env-example` file to create a `.env` file

:::note
The file must be named .env without extension and with a dot before the env word as required by Docker to read the environment variables
:::

In the `.env` file, edit the environment variables that docker compose will use to build and get the containers up and running.

:::note
You can set the Postgres database user and password in the `init.sh` file inside the `postgres\build`
:::

Here are the possible environment variables that can appear in the .env file.

:::note
server.example.com should be resolved by your DNS service if you want remote agents to be able to contact OpenUEM components
:::

:::danger
It's strongly recommended to change the JWT key with a random 32 characters long string
:::

## 3. Launch docker compose command

Where the compose.yaml file and the .env files are located, launch OpenUEM with the following commands:

```(bash)
docker compose --profile init up -d --build
```

Once we run that command, we should see that the database service is healthy and ready:

```
 ‚úî Network openuem_default  Created
 ‚úî Volume "openuem_pgdata"  Created
 ‚úî Container openuem-db-1   Healthy
 ‚úî Container openuem-certs  Started
```

Also, we should see that a certificates folder has been created containing all the required certificates:

![Certificates folder](/img/docker/certificates_folder.png)

:::warning
The generation of certificates can take some time, don't go to the next step until you check that certificates have been indeed created. If you find two files under the agents folder and one pfx file inside the users folder, you're good to go.
:::

Now, it's time to start OpenUEM's components

```(bash)
docker compose --profile openuem up -d --build
```

We should see that all components have started:

```
 ‚úî Volume "openuem_jetstream" Created
 ‚úî Container openuem-ocsp-responder-1 Started
 ‚úî Container openuem-nats-server Started
 ‚úî Container openuem-console-1 Started
 ‚úî Container openuem-notification-worker-1 Started
 ‚úî Container openuem-cert-manager-worker-1 Started
 ‚úî Container openuem-agents-worker-1 Started
```

If we want to stop OpenUEM we should run the following commands:

```(bash)
docker compose --profile openuem down
docker compose --profile init down
```

Before we can visit OpenUEM's console, we must import two digital certificates

:::warning
If you find any error trying to launch the services, run the docker compose down commands shown above, remove the volumes and the certificates folder and start again

```
docker volume rm openuem_jetstream
docker volume rm openuem_pgdata
```

Open an issue with all the possible information if you can't start OpenUEM with Docker
:::

## 4. Trust in digital certificates created

Next to the compose .yaml file you‚Äôll find a **certificates folder** containing all the certificates that OpenUEM has created and that are [required to run](/docs/Introduction/security).


## 5. Visit OpenUEM's Console

Now open `https://SERVER_NAME:CONSOLE_PORT` (replace the values that you've set in your .env file) and you should see OpenUEM's console

![Console LogIn](/img/console/login.png)

Finally, log in user your admin certificate and read how to install and add your first agent.

:::note
If you see any certificates error, please ensure that you've imported the right certificates in the right certificate stores of your browser
:::

## 6. Update

To update the Docker containers, use docker compose:

```(bash)
docker compose pull

docker compose --profile openuem up --force-recreate -d --build
```
