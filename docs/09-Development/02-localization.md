# Internationalization (i18n)

The most common way to contribute to an open-source project is to translate it to your favorite language. OpenUEM uses [ctxi18n](https://github.com/invopop/ctxi18n) to translate OpenUEM views using YAML files. Please, follow these steps to contribute your translation:

1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) the [open-uem/openuem-console repository](https://github.com/open-uem/openuem-console)
2. Go to the internal/views/locales folder and copy the en.yaml that contains the English strings.
3. Translate the existing strings into your language.
4. Name your file using a two-letter [ISO 639 code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639_language_codes) for your language.
5. Create a [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) and the language will be added after a review. And that's all.
