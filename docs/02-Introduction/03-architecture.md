# Architecture

**Agents** installed at your endpoints send reports that are processed by **agent workers**. Agent workers store agents' information into a **Postgres database**. The **Console** offers a web interface that allows you to browse the reported information and perform some tasks. Digital certificates used in OpenUEM are validated by the **OCSP responder**. New certificates are generated by the **cert-manager worker**. Email notifications are sent to your users using SMTP thanks to the **notification worker**. Communication between all these components is possible thanks to a [**NATS server**](https://docs.nats.io/).

All these components can be installed **on the same computer or on different computers** in a distributed setup.
