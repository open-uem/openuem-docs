# ðŸ”‘ Certificates

:::tip
This section is only available for the Global config
:::

OpenUEM uses digital certificates to establish mutual authentication and secure connections.

Every time the cert-manager tool is used to create a new certificate, for example when the server is installed and automatic generation has been selected, or if the cert-manager worker is required to generate a certificate for an agent or for a new user, information about the certificate is stored in the database.

The serial number of the certificate, the certificate type, a description, the expiration date of the certificate and the user associated with the certificate (if applicable) is stored in the database.

:::info
Thanks to the database, the [OCSP Responder](/docs/03-Introduction/07-ocsp.md) service could tell the different OpenUEM components if a certificate used to authenticate itâ€™s still valid.
:::

If you are in need of revoking a certificate, that is specify that a certificate is no longer valid, you can click on the three dots button to use the Revoke action.
