# üè∑ Tags

You can use tags to identify or classify your endpoints. Once you create the tags you can use them from the Agents and Computers views.

When you create a tag you must give it a name, an optional description and you can set its color (clicking on the palette icon and selecting the desired color).

Once the tag is created, you can start using it by selecting the tag from a menu. You can also visit the Tags section, by clicking on the **Add Tags** button.
