# ðŸ“’ Sessions

When a user logs into OpenUEM a new session is stored in the database. You can browse the sessions identified by the userâ€™s id, the detected browser and OS and its IP address. Also, you can check when the session is going to expire.

The session will close once the session lifetime expires, but if youâ€™re in need of closing a session, click on the three dots button to show the Delete action.
