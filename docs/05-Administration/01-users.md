# ðŸ‘¥ Users

OpenUEM allows you to add users that can log in to the console and work as administrators.

:::tip
This section is only available for the Global config
:::

:::note
OpenUEM will have roles and thereâ€™s an open issue for that feature in the projectâ€™s roadmap
:::

As an administrator you can add more users, or you can approve [register requests](/docs/04-Console/11-register.md) that users have requested.

:::warning
Donâ€™t forget to add [SMTP settings](/docs/05-Administration/04-smtp.md) so users can receive emails about the registration
:::

## 1. Create a new user

You can create a new user directly by clicking on the **Add User** button and by filling in the form fields.

The new user will show in the Usersâ€™ table with the state **Pending email confirmation**. An email will be sent to the user, so the email address is confirmed.

Hereâ€™s a sample of the message to confirm the email address.

The user registerâ€™s state will change to **Review request**. Now, go to the [approve request section](/docs/05-Administration/01-users.md#3-approve-register-requests)

## 2. Import users

OpenUEM lets you import many users using comma-separated values files (CSV).

Once you upload the users file, a certificate will be sent to the user with instructions to log in. So, by importing users, **you wonâ€™t have to approve the userâ€™s request, and the user wonâ€™t have to confirm the email address**.

## 3. Approve register requests

If you create a new user or a [user has requested to register in OpenUEM](/docs/04-Console/11-register.md) youâ€™ll see the user on the usersâ€™ table with the **Review request** warning, waiting to be approved.

Click on the three dots button to generate a digital certificate, accepting the request from the user.

The certificate will be sent to the user, and youâ€™ll see that the state will change to **Certificate sent**. The message will include the user certificate that has to be [imported](/docs/02-Installation/01-Server/04-docker.md#4-trust-in-digital-certificates-created) to the users's browser and the CA certificate that has to be imported as trusted authority too.

![Certificate message](/img/console/certificate_message.png)

Once the user logs in for the first time, youâ€™ll see that the state changes to **Completed**.

Otherwise delete the user and ignore the request.

## 4. Regenerate a certificate

If you need to generate a new certificate for one of your users, either the certificate was compromised or the user never received the certificate, you can click on the three dots icons and use the **Regenerate certificate** option. The old certificate will be automatically revoked, and a new certificate will be sent to the user.
