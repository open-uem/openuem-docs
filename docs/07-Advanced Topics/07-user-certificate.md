# ðŸ“ƒ Import certificates to your browser

You must import two certificates to your favorite browserâ€™s certificate store if you want to log in to the console and avoid the security warnings when you visit it. The Windows and Debian installers should add these certificates for you but if you need to import them, here's how you can do it.

## 1. The Certificate Authority (ca.cer):

The Certificate Authority (CA) certificate file should be in the `certificates/ca/ca.cer` in the docker compose folder, '`/etc/openuem-server/certificates/ca/ca.cer` in a Linux installation or `C:\Program Files\OpenUEM Server\certificates\ca\ca.cer` in a Windows installation. This certificate must be added to the trusted certificate authorities store.

You must import the certificate according to your browserâ€™s settings:

- In **Chrome** go to **Settings** -> **Privacy and Security**. Scroll and click on the **Security section**. Scroll to **Manage Certificates** and click on it. Click on **Installed by you** Manage certificates imported from Windows**. In Windows, import the administrator certificate in the **Personal tab** using the **changeit** password and the CA certificate in the **Trusted Root Certification Authorities tab**. In Linux, import the administrator certificate in the **Your certificates tab** using the **changeit** password and the CA certificate in the **Authorities tab**.
- In **Edge** go to **Settings** -> **Privacy, search, and services**. Scroll to **Security** and click on **Manage certificates**. Import the administrator certificate in the **Personal tab** using the **changeit** password and the CA certificate in the **Trusted Root Certification Authorities tab**.
- In **Firefox** go to **Settings** -> **Privacy and Security**. Find the **Security section** and in **Certificates** click on **View Certificates**. Then import the administrator certificate in the **Your certificates tab** using the **changeit** password and the CA certificate in the **Authorities tab**.

:::warning
In Windows, a warning will be shown when the Certificate Authority is imported. That warning is expected as you must confirm that you want to trust the certificates generated by this custom certificate authority.

## 2. The administrator certificate:

The file should be in `certificates/users/admin.pfx` in the docker compose folder, '`/etc/openuem-server/certificates/users/admin.pfx` in a Linux installation or `C:\Program Files\OpenUEM Server\certificates\users\admin.pfx` in a Windows installation. The certificate is protected with the password **changeit** by default unless you've set a different password when you installed OpenUEM.


:::note
If you use Mac and find problems importing the admin.pfx certificate to your Chrome browers or Keychain, like invalid password, you may have to convert the PFX file opening a MacOS terminal and executing the following commands:
```
openssl pkcs12 -in admin.pfx -out admin.pem
openssl pkcs12 -export -in admin.pem -out new_admin.pfx -legacy
```
Then import the new admin pfx file
